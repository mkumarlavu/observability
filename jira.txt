# JIRA Ticket: OpenTelemetry Auto-Instrumentation Connection Failures

## **Issue Type:** Bug
**Priority:** High  
**Component:** Observability/Monitoring  
**Affects Version:** Current  

---

## **Description**

The meks-sample-app Java Spring Boot application experiences connection failures and timeouts when OpenTelemetry auto-instrumentation is enabled. The application functions normally without auto-instrumentation but fails to export telemetry data when the Java agent is attached.

**Key Error Patterns:**
- gRPC connection failures to OpenTelemetry collector (status code 2)
- Socket timeouts and connection refused errors
- Repeated export failures to `opentelemetry-collector.opentelemetry.svc:5317`
- InterruptedIOException timeouts during telemetry data transmission

**Environment:**
- Application: meks-sample-app (Java Spring Boot)
- OpenTelemetry Java Agent version: [to be determined]
- Target collector endpoint: `opentelemetry-collector.opentelemetry.svc:5317`
- Runtime: Java (appears to be running in Kubernetes)

---

## **Steps to Reproduce**

1. Start meks-sample-app without OpenTelemetry auto-instrumentation â†’ Works normally
2. Enable OpenTelemetry auto-instrumentation Java agent
3. Start the application
4. Observe connection failures and timeout errors in application logs
5. Note that telemetry data is not being exported successfully

---

## **Expected Behavior**

- Application should start successfully with OpenTelemetry auto-instrumentation enabled
- Telemetry data (traces, metrics, logs) should be exported to the OpenTelemetry collector without errors
- No connection timeouts or gRPC failures should occur
- Application functionality should remain unaffected by instrumentation

---

## **Actual Behavior**

- Application experiences repeated connection failures to OpenTelemetry collector
- gRPC status code 2 errors occur continuously
- Socket timeouts and InterruptedIOExceptions are thrown
- Telemetry export operations fail consistently
- Application may experience performance degradation due to retry attempts

---

## **Acceptance Criteria**

### **Primary Criteria:**
- [ ] Application starts successfully with OpenTelemetry auto-instrumentation enabled
- [ ] Telemetry data exports successfully to the configured collector endpoint
- [ ] No connection timeout errors or gRPC failures occur during normal operation
- [ ] Application performance is not negatively impacted by instrumentation

### **Secondary Criteria:**
- [ ] Proper error handling and graceful degradation if collector is temporarily unavailable
- [ ] Configurable timeout and retry settings for telemetry export
- [ ] Clear logging that distinguishes between application errors and instrumentation issues
- [ ] Documentation updated with correct instrumentation configuration

### **Verification Steps:**
- [ ] Deploy application with auto-instrumentation in test environment
- [ ] Verify successful telemetry data flow to collector
- [ ] Confirm application logs show no instrumentation-related errors
- [ ] Validate that traces and metrics appear in monitoring dashboard
- [ ] Performance testing shows no significant degradation

---

## **Business Justification**

### **Impact on Operations:**
- **Observability Gap:** Without functioning auto-instrumentation, we lose critical application performance insights, distributed tracing capabilities, and monitoring data
- **Troubleshooting Efficiency:** Missing telemetry data significantly increases mean time to resolution (MTTR) for production issues
- **SLA Risk:** Inability to monitor application performance may lead to undetected issues affecting service level agreements

### **Business Value:**
- **Improved Incident Response:** Proper instrumentation enables faster root cause analysis and reduces downtime
- **Performance Optimization:** Telemetry data helps identify bottlenecks and optimization opportunities
- **Cost Management:** Better observability leads to more efficient resource utilization and cost control
- **Customer Experience:** Proactive monitoring helps prevent customer-facing issues

### **Risk Assessment:**
- **High Priority:** This blocks our observability strategy implementation
- **Security Consideration:** Ensure instrumentation doesn't introduce security vulnerabilities
- **Scalability Impact:** Proper telemetry is essential for scaling decisions and capacity planning

---

## **Potential Root Causes to Investigate**

1. **Network Connectivity:** Verify collector service is accessible from application pods
2. **Configuration Issues:** Check OpenTelemetry agent configuration and collector endpoint settings
3. **Authentication/Authorization:** Ensure proper credentials for collector access
4. **Resource Constraints:** Verify sufficient memory/CPU for instrumentation overhead
5. **Version Compatibility:** Check compatibility between Java agent and collector versions
6. **Firewall/Security Groups:** Validate network policies allow traffic to collector port

---

## **Suggested Investigation Steps**

1. Verify OpenTelemetry collector service is running and accessible
2. Check network connectivity from app to collector endpoint
3. Review OpenTelemetry agent configuration parameters
4. Test with minimal instrumentation configuration
5. Examine collector logs for incoming connection attempts
6. Validate Kubernetes service discovery and DNS resolution
