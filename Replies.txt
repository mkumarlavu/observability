Hi Robert,
Thanks for the update. I understand the current limitations better now:

OAS (Open source OTEL â†’ OAAS) doesn't support CloudWatch
eks-opentelemetry module doesn't support DT_SaaS or other vendors

CloudWatch-only approach:
What if we simplified this and used only CloudWatch for now? This would mean:

Leveraging the existing eks-opentelemetry module with CloudWatch integration
Accepting CloudWatch as our observability backend (at least initially)
Avoiding the complexity of integrating with DT_SaaS or other third-party vendors

This seems like it would work within current supported tooling and avoid the open source OTEL integration challenges you mentioned.
Request for guidance:

What's your recommendation for the best path forward given our current constraints?
If CloudWatch-only is viable, what would be the timeline for implementing this?
Can we prioritize this issue since observability is critical for our production workloads, and this simplified approach uses existing supported modules?

I'm flexible on the technical approach - the main goal is getting proper observability working in our Modular EKS environment. Would appreciate your thoughts on the most pragmatic solution we can move forward with.
