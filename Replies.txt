Infrastructure & Application Monitoring:

Distributed Tracing Infrastructure Monitoring using OneAgent deployment
Cluster Monitoring implementation using OneAgent
Configured DT SaaS integration in ECS environment with comprehensive monitoring of Hosts, Metrics, and Traces for Modernscore application

Dashboard & Visualization:

Successfully exported and migrated dashboards from DT Managed to SaaS environment

Cloud Integration:

Implemented Dynatrace SaaS CloudWatch integration for enhanced AWS monitoring capabilities

Synthetic Monitoring & Alerting:

Created and executed synthetic monitors for proactive application monitoring
Configured alerting profiles and problem notification workflows




Extensions Deployed:

eks-opentelemetry: OpenTelemetry Collector for metrics and traces collection
eks-xray: AWS X-Ray integration for distributed tracing
xray-setup: Configuration and setup utilities for X-Ray integration

‚úÖ Successfully Implemented Features
EKS Cluster-Level Monitoring:

Node Metrics: CPU, Memory, Network, and Disk utilization from all EKS nodes
Pod Metrics: Resource consumption, restart counts, and health status across namespaces
Cluster Metrics: Overall cluster health, API server metrics, and etcd performance
Kubernetes Events: Deployment, scaling, and error events from the cluster




Application-Level Monitoring:

Distributed Tracing: End-to-end request tracing across microservices
Service Maps: Since the application was simple hello world saw few dependency call patterns -- Need to verify properly.

Current Issues & Blockers
- IMDS Proxy Configuration Issue:

Root Cause: C2C team implemented changes to the Instance Metadata Service (IMDS) proxy configuration
Impact: Complete disruption of metrics transmission from EKS to CloudWatch using eks-opentelemetry module
Timeline: Issue started after the infrastructure change implementation
Action Taken: PCSR ticket raised with detailed error logs and configuration details

- eks-opentelemetry module not able to send logs to cloudwatch raised jira and shared my research to Robert, Poffle team.








‚úÖ Working Scenarios:

Infrastructure & Application Monitoring: OneAgent deployment for distributed tracing and cluster monitoring
Dynatrace SaaS integration: ECS environment monitoring (Hosts, Metrics, Traces for Modernscore application)
Dashboard Migration: Successfully exported and migrated dashboards from DT Managed to SaaS
Cloud Integration: Dynatrace SaaS CloudWatch integration for AWS monitoring
Synthetic Monitoring: Created and executed synthetic monitors with alerting profiles

‚ùå Not Working Scenarios:

EKS CloudWatch Metrics: Stopped working after C2C team's IMDS proxy changes (PCSR ticket raised)
OpenTelemetry Logs: Cannot send logs to CloudWatch (Jira raised, research shared with Robert/Poffle team)

üîÑ Work in Progress:

OAS Basic Understanding: Documentation completed
EKS with OAS - Dynatrace SaaS: In progress
ECS with OAS - Dynatrace SaaS: In progress
