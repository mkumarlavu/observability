Our OpenTelemetry observability stack is partially functional - metrics ✅ and traces ✅ are working, but log collection is blocked ❌ due to missing volume mounts in the Helm chart configuration.
Impact: Unable to achieve complete observability, limiting debugging capabilities and compliance reporting.
Required Action: Platform team needs to add volume mounts to our OpenTelemetry Helm chart for Kubernetes log file access.



🚨 Current Issue
Problem Statement
The OpenTelemetry collector cannot read Kubernetes pod logs, resulting in:

No application logs in CloudWatch
Incomplete observability stack
Error message: finding files: no files match the configured criteria

Root Cause Analysis
bash# Diagnostic command showing missing volume mounts:
kubectl describe pod opentelemetry-collector-* -n opentelemetry | grep -A 15 "Mounts:"

# Current mounts (what we have):
/conf from otc-internal (rw)
/tmp/ssl/certs from tls (rw)  
/var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount

# Missing mounts (what we need):
/var/log/pods from varlogpods (ro)        # ← MISSING
/var/log/containers from varlogcontainers (ro)  # ← MISSING

Deployment Configuration

Method: Helm Chart (opentelemetry-collector)
Namespace: opentelemetry
Mode: DaemonSet (required for log collection)
Security: Non-root, ReadOnly volumes



📝 Solution Specification
Helm Chart Modifications Required
File: opentelemetry/charts/opentelemetry-collector/values.yaml
Add Volume Configuration
yaml# Ensure DaemonSet mode for log collection
mode: daemonset

# Add volume definitions
extraVolumes:
  - name: varlogpods
    hostPath:
      path: /var/log/pods
      type: Directory
  - name: varlogcontainers
    hostPath:
      path: /var/log/containers
      type: Directory

# Add volume mounts
extraVolumeMounts:
  - name: varlogpods
    mountPath: /var/log/pods
    readOnly: true
  - name: varlogcontainers
    mountPath: /var/log/containers
    readOnly: true

# Security context (non-root)
securityContext:
  runAsNonRoot: true
  runAsUser: 65534
  fsGroup: 65534
Configuration Integration
The application team will handle the collector configuration update to include:

filelog receiver for log collection
awscloudwatchlogs exporter for CloudWatch integration
Log processing pipeline





🔄 Implementation Plan
Phase 1: Platform Team Tasks ⏱️ Est: 30 minutes

Review Security - Confirm hostPath volume approval
Update values.yaml - Add volume mount configuration
Deploy Changes - Helm upgrade with new configuration
Basic Verification - Confirm pods restart successfully

Phase 2: Application Team Tasks ⏱️ Est: 45 minutes

Update Config - Add filelog receiver and CloudWatch exporter
Deploy Configuration - Apply via Terraform
End-to-End Testing - Verify logs appear in CloudWatch
Documentation - Update runbooks and monitoring guides

Phase 3: Validation ⏱️ Est: 15 minutes

Monitoring - Set up alerting for log collection failures
Documentation - Update operational procedures
Knowledge Transfer - Brief support teams on new capabilities
